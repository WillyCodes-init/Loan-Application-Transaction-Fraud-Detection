## Problem Statement

Financial fraud poses a critical threat to the stability and integrity of financial institutions. Detecting fraudulent activities, whether in loan applications or transactions, remains a pressing challenge due to the ever-evolving tactics employed by fraudsters. This project aims to develop a robust risk assessment and fraud detection framework by leveraging machine learning techniques—primarily focusing on Bayesian methods—to evaluate and mitigate financial risks effectively.

### Why Bayesian First?

Bayesian methods offer a probabilistic approach to risk management by updating the likelihood of fraud as new evidence becomes available. This is particularly useful in financial fraud detection, where uncertainty and incomplete information are common. By applying Bayesian models, we can incorporate prior knowledge (e.g., historical fraud rates) and iteratively improve predictions as new transaction or loan application data emerges. This makes Bayesian techniques an excellent initial tool for constructing adaptive and interpretable risk models.

## Dataset Overview

This dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for exploring various aspects of financial fraud and customer behavior. It consists of two interconnected CSV files:

### 1. `loan_applications.csv`

Contains detailed information on loan applications, including:

* **Demographics:** Age, employment status, income, etc.
* **Financial Standing:** Credit score, outstanding debts, etc.
* **Loan Details:** Loan amount, term, purpose, etc.
* **Fraud Flag:** Binary indicator denoting whether the application is fraudulent (`1`) or legitimate (`0`).

This file is crucial for modeling the characteristics and patterns associated with potentially fraudulent loan applications.

---

### 2. `transactions.csv`

Captures the transactional behavior of customers, with features such as:

* **Transaction Type:** e.g., purchase, cash withdrawal, online payment.
* **Amount:** Monetary value of the transaction.
* **Merchant & Location:** Identifies where and with whom the transaction took place.
* **Fraud Flag:** Indicates fraudulent (`1`) or legitimate (`0`) transactions.

By analyzing this file, one can detect abnormal transaction behaviors that may signal fraud.

### Common Key

* Both datasets are linked via **`customer_id`**, allowing for enriched feature creation that combines static application data with dynamic transactional behavior.

---

## Potential Use Cases

* **Fraud Detection:**
  Build machine learning models (including Bayesian classifiers) to predict fraudulent loan applications and transactions.

* **Behavioral Analysis:**
  Examine customer spending and financial habits to spot inconsistencies or unusual patterns.

* **Risk Assessment:**
  Develop risk profiles for customers applying for loans by integrating application data and historical transaction behaviors.

* **Feature Engineering:**
  Construct new predictive features by merging the two datasets (e.g., recent large transactions before a loan application).

## Planned Approaches

1. **Bayesian Risk Modeling:**
   Employ Bayesian inference to assess the probability of fraud, updating risk estimates as new data becomes available.

2. **Descriptive & Predictive Modeling:**
   Utilize traditional machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to benchmark against Bayesian models.

3. **Anomaly Detection:**
   Apply unsupervised techniques to identify rare or abnormal transaction patterns indicative of fraud.

## Conclusion

This project integrates Bayesian principles as a cornerstone of its risk management strategy, supported by other machine learning and statistical methods. By leveraging the relationship between loan applications and transaction histories, the project seeks to uncover complex fraud patterns and contribute to more secure financial systems.
