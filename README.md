# Loan-Application-Transaction-Fraud-Detection

Dataset Overview
This dataset is designed to provide a rich source of information for tackling financial fraud. It comprises two interconnected CSV files: loan_applications.csv and transactions.csv.

loan_applications.csv
loan_applications.csv offers a detailed view into individual loan applications, capturing demographic information, financial standing, loan specifics, and the crucial fraud_flag indicating fraudulent applications. This dataset is invaluable for understanding the characteristics that might lead to fraudulent loan requests.

transactions.csv
transactions.csv provides a granular look at customer transaction history, including transaction types, amounts, merchant details, and location. Crucially, it also includes a fraud_flag for individual transactions, enabling the analysis of suspicious spending patterns.

The common customer_id across both files allows for a powerful linkage, enabling researchers and data scientists to build more sophisticated fraud detection systems by combining loan application characteristics with real-time transactional behavior.

This dataset is suitable for tasks such as:
Fraud Detection: Building models to predict fraudulent loan applications or transactions.

Behavioral Analysis: Understanding customer financial habits and identifying anomalies.

Risk Assessment: Developing comprehensive risk profiles for loan applicants.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features by combining information from both datasets
